Experimental Design Summary

missed data: 
location:(latitude, longitude, elevation),

fertilization:(total fertilizer applied, N amount, Nitrate in applied fertilizer, Ammonium in applied fertilizer, Urea in applied fertilizer),

initial condition:(initial water content, initial stable organic carbon, previous crop, residue incorporated, residue incorporation depth, weight aboveground residues, moisture in aboveground residues, N in aboveground residues)

weather:(temperature, dewpoint temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, ozone concentration, wind speed, weather station reference height)

Treatments:
7 plant density levels were applied: 5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 plants/m².

Irrigation:
Rainfed conditions (no supplementary irrigation).

Fertilization:
No mineral deficiency reported; no detailed fertilizer application data provided.

Chemical Treatments:
No disease incidence was observed; chemical usage not specified.

Field Location:
No exact description of the field location. The experiment is assumed to have taken place in Lelystad, Netherlands. However, the available weather data is from a station located approximately 100 km from Lelystad.

Weather Data
Weather information was obtained from literature and includes values recorded every six days for the following parameters:

Precipitation (mm)

Temperature (°C)

Solar radiation (J/cm²/day)
